#### Developing Data Products - Course Project

* This repo contains the ui.R and server.R files of the "Developing Data Products" Course project whose data comes from the mtcars dataset found in R. This is a Shiny application deployed using Rstudio on Shiny servers.

* This application was developed in fulfilment of the requirements for the Coursera "Developing Data Products" course. The application aids the user in the selection of the car that best suits their trip based on the variables provided by the user.

* All the user need to do is provide trip information such as distance to be travelled,gasoline price and maximum amount of money they are prepered to spend. Furthermore, the user needs to choose their desired vehicle charectristics such as number of cylinders, displacement, horse power and transmission type.

* The application will then use all the provided information to select the cars that match the provided criteria.
